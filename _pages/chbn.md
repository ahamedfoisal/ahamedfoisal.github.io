Starting with the CSV file it was hard to understand any piece of information from the file. Moreover, due to the uninteresting nature of the format, it was harder to find any information of value from the file. Working from the Harvard Art Museum website, it was easier to find the necessary information. It is also mentionable that due to the availability of pictures of the objects in addition to the organized user interface, it was more interesting to look through the website to 
find information about different objects.

One of the collections that was interesting to me was the painting “The Lobster” by Pablo Ruiz Picasso. Going through the metadata, it was found that the painting’s original title was “Le Homard” in the original language of the painter, French. The collection is dated back to 1949. Although it was created in France, the artwork is listed under the Spanish culture section.

 Another collection that was interesting to me was named The White Fence, Port Kent, New York. One interesting fact that I found in the metadata was that its technique is known as Photogravure. This was first published in 1917 but was acquired in 2009. It’s listed under the American culture section as it was taken in New York.

The third collection that I chose was titled “Inkstone Box (Suzuribako)”. This is a type of box that is dated back to the Early Edo Period, 17th century. The Edo period is defined as the years from 1615 to 1868. This was created in Japan and falls into the collection under Japanese Culture. This was acquired in 1996. 

As I had taken three art pieces from three different cultures - Spanish, American and Japanese. I would use these three as my choices for the next analysis using the Harvard API. 

Starting with Spanish culture. It is very noticeable that the first three most viewed art pieces in the Spanish culture section of the Harvard Art Museum website are three paintings from the same painter. Not unexpectedly these are the paintings titled “A Mother and Child and Four Studies of Her Right Hand”, https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/299997 , “Mother and Child” https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/299993 and “Woman with a Chignon” https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/229046 by Pablo Ruiz Picasso. The fact that all of these paintings were drawn by Picasso proves that he is the most famous artist in the Spanish culture in the eyes of the art appreciators of America. At least that’s what the HAM website’s view count tells us. 

When it comes to the ones with the least viewed paintings, these were the Farewell before boarding the command module by Joan Fontcuberta [https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/49921 ] A Spanish Knights Kills the Bull after Having Lost His Horse	Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes	Spanish	https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/277220 They Loose Dogs on the Bull	by Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes		https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/277714 Fool's Folly by Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes		https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/342804 Quien se Pondra el Cascabel al Gato? by Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes	[https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/370276 ]. All of these had zero views. Similar to the case of Picasso, we can also see that one artist Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes had the most number of arts unviewed. This might be because the art appreciators in HAM have little to no knowledge of the artist. 




For the Spanish culture section of the Harvard Art Museum (HAM) website, the most viewed items are:

“A Mother and Child and Four Studies of Her Right Hand” by Pablo Ruiz Picasso. Link https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/299997

All the artworks mentioned are from Spanish culture. The most viewed items are by Pablo Ruiz Picasso, a renowned Spanish painter and sculptor, known for co-founding the Cubist movement. The least viewed items are primarily by Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes, a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker, and one by Joan Fontcuberta, a contemporary artist known for his works in photography and media.

While it's not surprising that Picasso's works are among the most viewed given his global fame, it is somewhat surprising to see multiple works by Goya with zero views. Goya is considered one of the most important Spanish artists, and his works have been influential. The disparity in views might be indicative of the general public's familiarity with artists or perhaps the way the museum's online platform promotes or displays certain artworks. This speaks about the general understanding of the art appreciators of HAM who may have not been introduced to many of the important figures of the Spanish art history other than the name of Picasso. 

As we start browsing through the charts. It is clear that the number of American art pieces far outweigh those of the Japanese and the Spanish. In fact the American art work is more that 8 times the amount that the Japanese.  When we go through the Accession year bar chart it becomes very obvious that the number of American art works are so high that the information about other cultures cannot be seen very clearly. For the sake of clarification, the accession year bar graphs of other three cultures are given separately in this article. 

When we look through the graph of the Japanese culture, it can be seen that there is a big spike in the year 1933. This is the year when the HAM acquired 3115 pieces of all of the total art pieces. This is nearly half of the total amount of art pieces present in the museum currently.



Looking through the graph of Spanish culture, we can see that the number of art pieces acquired has never been very much, the highest amount reaching nearly 100 around the year 1930. 
In the case of American culture, the number of pieces acquired was never more than 5k throughout the time apart from the sudden spike in 2011 where the museum received 30.78k pieces of American Culture. 

While making the word cloud, the English stopwords package was used. Furthermore, words like Nan, which signal the absence of information for a field, were also removed from the cloud.

While analyzing the Japanese culture, the wordcloud shows that the most used word is series, indicating that most of the Japanese culture art pieces in the museum are a part of a series. Furthermore, the frequent presence of words like Tale and Poem also signify that the HAM mostly focused on art pieces that told a story from the Japanese culture.

In case of the American culture, it is very visible that the most used words are simply the name of the locations. This signifies that the American culture enthusiasts used to name their pieces in accordance with the places where they were created. 
In the Spanish word clout we can see that the words standing out are Woman, Saint, Man etc. This is probable from the presence of Christian influence in the Spanish culture where the woman most possibly refers to Mother Mary.
