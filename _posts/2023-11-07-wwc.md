Jules Verne, often heralded as a founding father of science fiction, was a prolific writer whose works transcended the boundaries of his time, painting vivid canvases of exploration, adventure, and technological marvels. Born in Nantes, France, in 1828, Verne channeled his passion for discovery and innovation into his writing, resulting in a new genre that combined scientific fact with fiction in a way that was both educational and thrilling. His "Voyages Extraordinaires" series sought to educate the populace about the natural and technological world, all the while entertaining with narratives of daring expeditions and pioneering journeys.

The three books chosen for this assignment — "Around the World in Eighty Days," "Journey to the Center of the Earth," and "The Mysterious Island" — epitomize Verne's style and thematic preoccupations. Each text takes its protagonists, and thereby readers, through uncharted territories and groundbreaking explorations, reflecting the human spirit's unquenchable thirst for knowledge and the unknown. These texts not only serve as cornerstones of the science fiction genre but also offer a window into the zeitgeist of the 19th century, characterized by a fervent enthusiasm for progress and discovery.

"Around the World in Eighty Days" chronicles the race against time as the unflappable Phileas Fogg wagers his entire fortune on the possibility of circumnavigating the globe in eighty days. It is a celebration of human ingenuity and the possibilities brought about by the advancements in transportation and communication of the era.

"Journey to the Center of the Earth" ventures into the subterranean depths, offering readers a glimpse of what might lie beneath their feet. The novel is a testament to Verne's ability to stretch the imagination to its limits, proposing elaborate underground landscapes and prehistoric creatures long before the advent of modern paleontology.

"The Mysterious Island" tells the tale of stranded men who utilize their scientific knowledge to survive and uncover the mysteries of their remote location. It is a narrative rich in themes of survival, innovation, and the human capacity to adapt and utilize science for overcoming adversity.

Each of these works was chosen not only for its representation of Verne's narrative artistry but also for the different stages of his career they represent, showcasing his evolution as a writer and a thinker. They offer a diverse corpus for computational exploration — from the early adventurous optimism of "Journey to the Center of the Earth" to the mature reflection on human ingenuity and resilience in "The Mysterious Island."

Using the R notebooks, I first made a word cloud consisting of the words mostly used in the three books. At a first glance, one of the things that become noticeable is the big size of names like Pencroft, Harding, Fogg, Cyrus, Passepartout and  Herbert. It becomes evident that these people are the most important characters in the book. Apart from that, these names do not provide much so we input the names in the stopwords list so that we can do a more detailed analysis of the corpus.

Removing the names, this is what the word cloud looks like this.

This word cloud visually represents the frequency of words from a given text, with larger and bolder words indicating higher frequency. Dominant words such as "island," "said," "engineer," "replied," "time," "captain," "great," "water," and "sailor" suggest a nautical or adventure theme, possibly from a novel or a series of narratives involving exploration or seafaring. The prominence of character titles like "captain" and "engineer," along with action words like "asked," "cried," and "replied," implies a story with rich dialogue and interaction. The words "granite," "neb," and "rocks" could point to specific geological features that are relevant within the text, perhaps relating to the setting of the island. Overall, the word cloud gives an impression of a maritime adventure story with a focus on characters' dialogues, roles, and a distinct setting.

Through the data from the corpus, I build the relative frequency curve of the graph using Voyant tools.

Through the data from the corpus, I build the relative frequency curve of the graph using Voyant tools. Analyzing the graph indicates the following patterns across these novels:

"Said" is most frequently used in "Around the World in 80 Days," which could reflect the dialog-heavy style of this adventure novel as characters interact on their journey.

"Island" understandably has the highest frequency in "The Mysterious Island," given that the setting and subject of the book revolve around an island.

"Time" increases in frequency in "The Mysterious Island," which may relate to the numerous temporal references as the castaways organize their survival and exploration.

"Replied" shows a substantial increase in "The Mysterious Island," which, like "said," may reflect more dialogue and interaction among the characters stranded on the island.

"Cyrus" is a character from "The Mysterious Island," hence the spike in frequency in this book, since he is one of the main characters and is not present in the other two novels.

To derive a more interesting analysis, I chose a few words of the same nature from the most used words’ list. These were “island”, “sea”, “water” and “sailor”.

“Island" is more prominent in "The Mysterious Island" for obvious reasons, as the story centers around the survival and adventures of castaways on an uncharted island.

"Sea" shows a slight increase in "Around the World in 80 Days," likely due to the various sea voyages that the characters undertake as part of their global journey. It then dips in "Journey to the Center of the Earth," which is focused on subterranean exploration rather than maritime travel, and finally increases again in "The Mysterious Island," where the sea would be a significant element of the setting and narrative.

"Water" has the lowest frequency in "Journey to the Center of the Earth," which makes sense as the novel is more about underground exploration, although underground bodies of water are a plot element. It peaks in "The Mysterious Island," aligning with the survival theme where finding and managing water resources would be crucial.

"Sailor" peaks in "The Mysterious Island," which corresponds to the characters' backgrounds and the maritime setting of the novel. It has a lower frequency in "Around the World in 80 Days" and "Journey to the Center of the Earth," as those stories focus less on nautical themes.

The patterns reflected in this graph underscore the thematic and setting differences among the three novels, with "The Mysterious Island" having a strong maritime and island survival theme, hence the higher frequency of related words.

Another similar word choice was made with a different theme in mind. The words chosen were, “journey”, “dark” and “danger”.

"Journey" peaks in "Journey to the Center of the Earth," which is expected since the novel is about a literal and metaphorical journey into the Earth's depths. The word maintains a steady presence in the other two novels, likely referencing the travels and adventures central to their plots.

"Dark" also reaches its highest point in "Journey to the Center of the Earth," reflecting the novel's subterranean setting where the absence of natural light is a prominent feature. The word appears less frequently in "Around the World in 80 Days" and "The Mysterious Island," possibly used more metaphorically or during descriptions of night or obscured settings.

“Danger” has a very similar relative frequency in the three texts as “Dark”. Thus it emphasizes the fact that dark has mostly been used in the text as a synonymous word for perilous or dangerous rather than the usual definition of the absence of light. 

Using the same words, a bubble lines was created.

We can see the following patterns in the bubblelines:

"Journey" appears regularly throughout all three novels, which is fitting given that each story revolves around a central journey or adventure.

"Dark" has several clusters of occurrences in "A Journey to the Center of the Earth," which correlates with the novel's underground setting where darkness would be a prevailing condition. There are fewer instances in the other two novels, indicating that darkness is not as prominent a theme.

"Danger" is more evenly spread out in "A Journey to the Center of the Earth" and "The Mysterious Island," suggesting a consistent presence of peril or threats in these stories. In "Around the World in 80 Days," the occurrences are fewer and more scattered, indicating that danger is not a constant presence but arises occasionally as the protagonists race against the clock.
